How the program works:
The program reads all the file within the specified directory and uses multiple threads to increase performance. The number of threads will be specified by the user. The program will give the user information on which thread is reading/processing which file. It will also inform the user which thread has finished.

How to run the program:
Before running the program please make sure the program is up to date by using the 'make' command. Then type './testmulthreads' and the number of thread you want to be running. The output will be under the results folder under results.txt.
