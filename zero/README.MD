This program is meant to go through every ".txt" file 
within the directory defined by the given path and count the occurence of either alphabet character
or special characters within these files. Once program is executed, output could be found in result folder. 
The output of the .txt file will be as follow in the Intended Results part of this document. To execute file
follow instructions in the assignment pdf
